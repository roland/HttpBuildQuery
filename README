HttpBuildQuery
====================

What it is?
----------

This is a C# version of the http://php.net/http_build_query. 
I had a hard time finding a replacement for http_build_query in .NET as I was working with the MailChimp API and wrote this as a helper.


Usage
----------

HttpBuildQueryHelper.Format(HttpBuildQueryHelper.Convert(myObject))

HttpBuildQueryHelper.Convert - recursively uses reflection to create a strucutre that HttpBuildQueryHelper.Format can use.

You can also use anonymous types:

HttpBuildQueryHelper.Format(HttpBuildQueryHelper.Convert(new { myKey = new int[] {1,2,3} } ))

which will generate "myKey[0]=1&myKey[1]=2&myKey[2]=3".
